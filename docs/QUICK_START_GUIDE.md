# Quick Start Guide - Cookie Capture Fix

## What Was Fixed

Your extension was not capturing cookies because it only monitored HTTP headers, but many websites set cookies via JavaScript. We've now added a dual capture system that catches cookies from BOTH sources.

## Quick Test (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Multi-Session Manager"
3. Click the **Reload** button (circular arrow icon)

### Step 2: Open Console
1. On the same page, click **"Inspect background page"** (under the extension)
2. A DevTools window will open - this shows all console logs

### Step 3: Create First Session
1. Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Click **"New Session"** button
3. Navigate to your test website (e.g., portal.seibinsurance.com)
4. Log in with first account

### Step 4: Watch Console
You should immediately see messages like:
```
[chrome.cookies.onChanged] Cookie changed: SessionID for domain: portal.seibinsurance.com
[session_xxx] Captured cookie SessionID via chrome.cookies API
[session_xxx] Removed browser cookie: SessionID
```

**If you see these messages, THE FIX IS WORKING!** ‚úÖ

### Step 5: Test Isolation
1. Click extension icon again
2. Click **"New Session"** (creates second session)
3. Navigate to the SAME website
4. **You should NOT be logged in** (cookies are isolated)
5. Log in with a DIFFERENT account

### Step 6: Verify Both Work
1. Switch between the two tabs
2. Each should show a different account logged in
3. Console should show cookie injection messages:
   ```
   [session_xxx] Found 3 cookies for portal.seibinsurance.com
   [session_xxx] Injecting 3 cookies for portal.seibinsurance.com
   ```

## What Changed

### New Features Added:

1. **Chrome Cookies API Monitoring** (background.js lines 543-634)
   - Captures cookies set via JavaScript (`document.cookie`)
   - Works for cookies set after page load
   - Automatically removes from browser's native store

2. **Periodic Cookie Cleanup** (background.js lines 689-704)
   - Runs every 2 seconds
   - Removes any cookies that leak into browser store
   - Maintains strict isolation

3. **Initial Cookie Clearing** (background.js lines 333-364)
   - Clears existing cookies when creating new session
   - Ensures clean slate for each session

4. **Enhanced Logging** (background.js lines 530-571)
   - Shows exactly what's happening with cookies
   - Helps diagnose issues quickly

## Console Messages Explained

### Good Messages (Everything Working)
```
‚úÖ [chrome.cookies.onChanged] Cookie changed: SessionID
   ‚Üí Cookie was detected when website set it

‚úÖ [session_xxx] Captured cookie SessionID via chrome.cookies API
   ‚Üí Cookie was saved to session store

‚úÖ [session_xxx] Removed browser cookie: SessionID
   ‚Üí Cookie was removed from browser (isolation maintained)

‚úÖ [session_xxx] Found 3 cookies for example.com
   ‚Üí Session has cookies ready to inject

‚úÖ [session_xxx] Injecting 3 cookies for example.com
   ‚Üí Cookies being sent to server with request
```

### Warning Messages (Need Attention)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è [onHeadersReceived] No Set-Cookie headers found
   ‚Üí Website setting cookies via JavaScript (normal, our fix handles this)

‚ö†Ô∏è [onBeforeSendHeaders] No session for tab 123
   ‚Üí Tab not assigned to session (create session first)

‚ö†Ô∏è [chrome.cookies.onChanged] No tabs found for domain
   ‚Üí Cookie set but no session tabs match domain
```

### Error Messages (Something Wrong)
```
‚ùå Failed to persist sessions
   ‚Üí Storage error, check chrome.storage permissions

‚ùå Failed to remove browser cookie
   ‚Üí Isolation may be compromised, check cookies permission
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still not seeing cookie capture messages

**Solution 1:** Check manifest permissions
```json
"permissions": [
  "cookies",  ‚Üê Must be present
  "webRequest",
  "webRequestBlocking",
  ...
]
```

**Solution 2:** Clear ALL browser cookies first
1. DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies
2. Delete all cookies for your test website
3. Close all tabs for that website
4. Try again with new session

**Solution 3:** Test with simple website
Try a simple cookie test site to verify the extension works:
- http://www.allaboutcookies.org/verify-cookies
- https://cookie-script.com/cookie-consent-checker

### Problem: Second session sees first session's cookies

**Solution 1:** Wait for cleanup cycle
- Periodic cleanup runs every 2 seconds
- Wait 2-3 seconds after logging in
- Then create second session

**Solution 2:** Manually clear browser cookies
1. DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies
2. Delete all cookies
3. Create new sessions

**Solution 3:** Check for errors in console
- Look for "Failed to remove browser cookie" errors
- These indicate permission issues

### Problem: Cookies not persisting across page navigation

**Solution:** Check console for storage errors
- Look for "Failed to persist sessions" messages
- May indicate storage quota exceeded
- Try clearing old sessions

## Performance Notes

- **Periodic cleanup:** Runs every 2 seconds (minimal CPU usage)
- **Storage writes:** Debounced to 1 per second (prevents excessive writes)
- **Memory usage:** Only stores cookies for active sessions
- **No impact** on non-session tabs

## File Changes Summary

Only ONE file was modified:
- **d:\Downloads\_TEMP\my-multisession-extension\background.js**
  - Added ~160 lines of new code
  - No breaking changes
  - Fully backward compatible

## Next Steps

1. **Test the extension** with your actual website
2. **Monitor the console** for cookie capture messages
3. **Verify isolation** by creating multiple sessions
4. **Report results** - what works, what doesn't

## Support

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check console logs** - Copy entire console output
2. **Check Network tab** - Look for Set-Cookie headers
3. **Test with different website** - Rule out site-specific issues
4. **Check Chrome version** - Extension requires Chrome 80+

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Extension reloaded without errors
- [ ] Console shows cookie capture messages when logging in
- [ ] Second session does NOT inherit first session's cookies
- [ ] Each session maintains its own login state
- [ ] Console shows periodic cleanup messages every 2 seconds
- [ ] No errors in background page console
- [ ] Sessions persist after closing/reopening browser

If ALL checkboxes are checked, **THE FIX IS WORKING PERFECTLY!** üéâ

## What To Expect

### Before the fix:
- Cookies not captured
- Sessions share same login state
- Second session sees first session's cookies
- Console shows no cookie storage messages

### After the fix:
- Cookies captured from ALL sources (HTTP + JavaScript)
- Sessions completely isolated
- Each session has own login state
- Console shows detailed cookie flow
- Periodic cleanup prevents leakage

## Timeline

- **Immediate:** Cookie capture works
- **2 seconds:** First cleanup cycle runs
- **Every 2 seconds:** Cleanup maintains isolation
- **On navigation:** Cookies injected automatically
- **On browser restart:** Sessions persist (loaded from storage)
