## 💰 Pricing Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Generous Free Tier** - Build user base and trust
2. **Value-Based Pricing** - Price based on value delivered, not cost
3. **Simple Tiers** - Easy to understand, easy to choose
4. **Annual Incentive** - Encourage longer commitment with 50% discount
5. **Fair & Transparent** - No hidden fees, no surprises

## 📊 Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Monthly | Annual | Daily Cost | Coffee Equivalent |
|------|---------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Free** | $0 | $0 | $0 | Free |
| **Premium** | $4.99 | $29.99 | $0.16/day | Less than 1 coffee/month |
| **Enterprise** | $9.99 | $59.99 | $0.32/day | Less than 2 coffees/month |

### Why These Prices?

**Premium ($4.99/month)**
- **Psychology**: Under $5 feels like "pocket change"
- **Competitive**: SessionBox charges $7.99/month (we're cheaper)
- **Value**: 10-15 hours saved/month = $100-$500 value
- **ROI**: 20-100x return on investment
- **Impulse Buy**: Low enough to buy without approval

**Enterprise ($9.99/month)**
- **Under $10**: Still feels reasonable
- **2x Premium**: Clear value differentiation
- **Team Justification**: $10/user/month is easily expensed
- **Enterprise**: Low enough to scale to teams

**Annual Discount (50%)**
- **Cash Flow**: Immediate revenue vs. monthly drip
- **Retention**: Longer commitment = less churn
- **Psychology**: "Save $30" is compelling
- **Industry Standard**: Most SaaS offer 40-50% annual discount

## 💡 Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring Effect
Present prices in this order:
1. **Enterprise** ($9.99) - Anchor high
2. **Premium** ($4.99) - Looks like a great deal
3. **Free** ($0) - Highlight limitations

### Framing
- ❌ "$59.99 per year"
- ✅ "$29.99 per year (save 50%!)"
- ✅ "Just $0.16 per day"
- ✅ "Less than 1 coffee per month"

### Urgency (Optional)
- "Launch Special: 20% off first year"
- "Early Adopter Lifetime Deal: $99 one-time"
