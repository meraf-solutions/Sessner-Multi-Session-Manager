Hi [subreddit name],

[Personal story - why I built this]

I've been managing multiple client accounts and constantly switching between
browser profiles. It was slow and annoying. So I built Sessner - a multi-session
manager that creates isolated sessions per tab.

[What it does]

Each tab gets its own session with separate cookies/storage. You can:
‚Ä¢ Run multiple accounts on any website simultaneously
‚Ä¢ Switch between accounts by switching tabs (instant)
‚Ä¢ Never worry about logging in/out

[Proof/credibility]
‚Ä¢ Just launched on Edge Add-ons Store
‚Ä¢ Featured on Product Hunt
‚Ä¢ Built with [tech stack]

[Call to action]
Try it free (3 sessions): [link]
Upgrade for unlimited: $4.99/month

Happy to answer questions!
