## üÜì Free Tier Strategy

### Philosophy: "Generous but Limited"

The free tier must be:
1. **Functional**: Solves the core problem
2. **Not Frustrating**: No artificial wait times or popups
3. **Limited**: Clear ceiling that requires upgrade
4. **Fair**: Existing sessions never blocked (grandfathered)

### Free Tier Limits

| Feature | Free | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Concurrent Sessions** | 3 | Enough for personal use, not for professional |
| **Session Persistence** | 7 days inactive | Encourages regular use, upgrade for permanent |
| **Badge Colors** | 6 colors | Sufficient for 3 sessions, upgrade for more |
| **Session Naming** | ‚ùå | Organizational feature = premium value |
| **Export/Import** | ‚ùå | Backup/restore = professional need |
| **Session Templates** | ‚ùå | Workflow optimization = power user |

### Why 3 Sessions is the Perfect Limit

- **Personal Use**: Work email + Personal email + Shopping = 3 ‚úÖ
- **Light Professional**: Sufficient for casual multi-account use ‚úÖ
- **Heavy Professional**: 5-20 accounts = must upgrade ‚úÖ
- **Psychology**: 3 feels generous (not 2), but limited (not 5+)

---

Target users who:
- Manage **5+ accounts** regularly

- Value of 10-15 hours: **$100-$500** (depending on hourly rate)
- Cost: **$5/month**
- **ROI: 20-100x**

### Premium Positioning Messages

1. "Upgrade to unlimited sessions"
2. "For professionals managing multiple accounts"
